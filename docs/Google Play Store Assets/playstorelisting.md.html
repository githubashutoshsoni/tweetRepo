<p>If you are a developer or designer that needs to leave your phone running for
  long periods of time without the screen turning off, then this is the app for
  you! If you've ever used Caffeine for Mac, this is a similar utility for Android
  N and O.</p>

<p>Awake is a tiny app that creates a Tile in your Quick Settings. Once you install
  the app, you have to customize your Quick Settings tiles. </p>

<ul>
  <li>Simply drag and drop Awake into the set of active tiles.</li>

  <li>Then click on the tile to activate it.</li>

  <li>If you click on the tile again, it will deactivate the app.</li>
</ul>

<p>While your phone is charging, Awake will not allow the screen to dim or
  go to sleep. As soon as your phone is no longer charging, Awake will turn
  itself off. By default, once Awake is activated, it will keep your screen
  awake for 1 hour, with or without charging. You can stop and start Awake at
  anytime, simply by clicking on its Quick Settings tile.</p>
